# AcolyteProject
This project is my pet-project. I was trying to create an app, which can visualise (a little bit) results of a code I wrote for some of my exercises.
It is not completed yet.
For now you can just click on two first buttons (with icons). First button runs a script that is supposed to find odd integer in the array full of evens numbers (with only one odd). Script can also find one even in odd array.
Second button calculates how many times a person can see a bouncing ball falling from height. 
Both scripts have only one input now.
